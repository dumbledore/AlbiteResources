This is a '''glossary of legal terms'''. Terms that are in a foreign language are ''italicized'' in their title, and the italicized word or phrase is in [[Latin]] unless its definition indicates the italicized term is from some other language.  There is also a much longer list of [[Appendix:Legal terms]], one without definitions, in Latin.  There is a US bias in some definitions; though many of these terms are used in other jurisdictions with the same or similar meaning.

==A==
; ''A mensa et toro'' : Alternatively written as ''a mensa et thoro'' (a [[Medieval Latin#Changes in orthography|medieval orthographic innovation]] to discourage [[vowel|intervocalic]] [[Palatal consonant|palatalization]]); literally "from table and cushion", but generally translated as "from bed and board."  A divorce ''a mensa et toro'', is rather a [[separation]] of the parties by act of law, than a [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]] of the marriage. It may be granted for the causes of extreme cruelty or desertion of the wife by the husband. 2 Eccl. Rep. 208. This kind of divorce does not affect the legitimacy of children, nor authorize a second marriage. V. [[A vinculo matrimonii]]; Cruelty Divorce.

; ''A vinculo matrimonii'' : Literally "from the bond of marriage." A marriage may be dissolved ''a vinculo'', in many states, as in [[Pennsylvania]], on the ground of [[canons of statutory construction|canon]]ical disabilities before marriage, as that one of the parties was legally married to a person who was then living; [[impotence]], (q. v.,) and the like [[adultery]] [[cruelty]] and [[malice (legal term)|malicious]] [[desertion]] for two years or more. In [[New York]] a sentence of [[imprison]]ment for life is also a ground for a divorce a vinculo. When the marriage is dissolved a vinculo, the parties may marry again but when the cause is [[adultery]], the guilty party cannot marry his or her [[paramour]].

; ''[[ab initio]]'' : Literally "from the beginning." When an agreement is for legal reasons void ''ab initio'', it is void for all purposes throughout the period of its purported existence, and not merely from the moment that it is declared to have been void by the Court. When a man enters upon lands or into the house of another by [[authority of law]], and afterwards abuses that authority, he becomes a [[trespass]]er ''ab initio''. Bac. Ab. Trespass, B.; 8 Coke, 146 2 Bl. Rep. 1218 Clayt. 44. And if an officer neglects to remove goods attached within a reasonable time and continue in possession, his entry becomes a trespass ''ab initio''. 2 Bl. Rep. 1218. See also as to other cases, 2 Stra. 717 1 H. Bl. 13 11 East, 395 2 Camp. 115 2 Johns. 191; 10 Johns. 253; ibid. 369. but in case of an [[authority in fact]], to enter, an abuse of such authority will not, in general, subject the party to an action of [[trespass]], Lane, 90 ; Bae. Ab. Trespass, B ; 2 T. It. 166. See generally 1 Chit. PI. 146. 169. 180.

; ''Aberemurder'' : Obsolete: an apparent, plain, or downright [[murder]]. It was used to distinguish a wilful murder from a chance-medley or [[manslaughter]]. [[Henry Spelman|Spelman]]; Cowell; Blount.

; Abet : To encourage or set another on to commit a [[crime]]. This word is always taken in a bad sense. To abet another to commit a murder, is to command, procure, or counsel him to commit it. Old Nat. Brev 21; Col Litt. 475.

; Abettor : One who encourages or incites, persuades or sets another on to commit a [[crime]]. Such a person is either a [[:wikt:principal|principal]] or, an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the crime. When present, aiding, where a [[felony]] is committed, he is guilty as principal in the second degree ; when absent, "he is merely an accessory." 1. Russell, 21; 1 Leach 66; Foster 428. ''Source: Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, Revised, 1856.''

; [[accessory|Accessory]] : A person who knows of, and assists in, the commission of a [[crime]], but is not present when the crime is committed.

A person cannot be an accessory unless a crime is eventually committed.

; [[accomplice|Accomplice]] : Individual who voluntarily engages with another in the commission or attempted commission of a crime.

; Alibi : A provable account of an individual's whereabouts at the time of the commission of a crime which would make it impossible or impractical to accuse the person.

; [[alternative dispute resolution]] : Resolution of a dispute through negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or similar means, as opposed to litigation.

; ''[[amicus curiae|Amicus curiae]]'' : A "friend of the court". When an important or difficult point is being argued in an adversarial system of law (such as the common law of England and the United States), but one part of the argument is inadequately represented (perhaps because a party is not interested in arguing it, or does not have the resources to argue it properly), the Court may appoint an ''Amicus curiae,'' to ensure that that part of the argument is sufficiently explored and is fully argued independently of the party upon whom the burden of that argument would ordinarily fall.  One, who as a stander by, when a judge is doubtful or mistaken in a matter of law, may inform the court. 2 Inst. 178; 2 Vin. Abr. 475; and any one, as amicus curia, may make an application to the court in favor of an infant, though he be no relation. 1 Ves. Sen. 313. AMITA. A paternal aunt; the sister of one's father. Inst. 3, 6, 3.

It is named for the ''Anton Piller'' case (frequently misspelt ''Anton Pillar''), but the same remedy had been granted prior to this decision, in ''EMI v Pandit''.

; [[appeal|Appeal]] : Process by which a case is brought from one court to a higher court for review.

; [[appellant|Appellant]] : In a new case (an appeal), either the [[claimant]], [[defendant]], or [[respondent]] from the lower case, depending on who was the losing party. The winning party from the lower court, however, is now the ''respondent.''

; [[appellee]] : A respondent.

; [[arbitration]] : A legal technique for the resolution of disputes outside the courts, wherein the parties to a dispute refer it to one or more persons (the "arbitrators", "arbiters" or "arbitral tribunal"), by whose decision (the "award") they agree to be bound.

; Arraignment : In criminal cases, a court hearing where the defendant is advised to the charges and asked to plead guilty or not guilty.

; ''Arguendo'' : "For purposes of argument", as in "assuming 'arguendo' that my opponent's contentions are correct."  [In Latin, ''arguendo'' is a [[gerund]] [[dative of purpose]].  Its most literal translation from Latin is "for (the sake of) asserting."]<p>The term is most often used in the following [[logic|logical]] context<p>P1 argues "X is a result of Y"<p>P2 responds "While you may or may not be correct that X is a result of Y, assuming 'arguendo,' that you are correct, you still fail to account for the existence of Z, which makes null your contention.

; [[attorney]] : In the United States, a lawyer; one who advises or represents others in legal matters as a profession.

==B==
; [[Bailment]] : A transfer of possession of a chattel from a '''bailor''' to a '''bailee''' without transfer of legal or equitable title. A bailor can demand the return of the property at any time from the bailee. Often, sub-bailments may be created; for example, in a situation where property is being couriered, if the delivery van breaks down, the courier bailee may sub-bail the goods to another deliverer. It is not a security in the legal sense.

; [[burden of persuasion]] : The duty upon a party in a legal proceeding to persuade the fact-finder to decide for that party on an assertion of fact; part of the burden of proof, sometimes loosely used as synonym for that term.

; Class Action : Lawsuit brought  by a representative member(s) of a large group of people on behalf of all members.

; Conviction : To be found by a judge or jury to have violated a law.  Note that a conviction does not necessarily mean the person has committed a crime.  A person who receives a parking ticket or a traffic ticket only punishable by a fine and is found guilty stands ''convicted'' of the charge even though traffic and parking offences are not crimes.

; [[crime|Crime]] : A violation of law which is an offence against the state and generally punishable by some form of penalty which could include prison or jail time. Crimes are defined as serious [[felony|felonies]] or less serious [[misdemeanour]]s.  A violation of law which only has a monetary penalty is not a crime ''per se'', but an [[infraction]].

; [[change of venue|Change of venue]] : A change of venue is a legal term that means that a case before a court will be heard in another [[jurisdiction]] versus the one where the said crime took place. This is done when there is a reason to think that a [[defendant]] will not receive a fair trial, for whatever the reason.

; ''[[Estoppel]]'' : A principle of equity whereby a person is not allowed (is, therefore, estopped) from maintaining or relying upon the existence of a certain state of affairs.  It is often said to be a shield not a sword, ''i.e.,'' to afford a defence to a claim rather than the basis for a claim, but in certain cases the effect of an estoppel is to confer actionable legal rights.  If, for example, a promise is made which is not legally enforceable because there has been no consideration provided for it, and it would be inequitable for the promise to be broken, the promisor may be estopped from reneging on the promise.

; Exhibit : The paper, document, or other physical object received by the court as evidence during a trial.

; ''[[Ex parte]]'' : By or for one party without notification of nor representation on behalf of other parties.  A variant is ''ex parte on notice'' where the other party has received informal or short notice, but not formal or full notice.  When an application is made ex parte the other side is not heard, and there is therefore an obligation of full and frank disclosure on the part of the applicant in order to present a fair picture to the Court being asked to make any decision.

; Express authority : An employee who is hired by agreement (oral or written) is an agent and has been given express authority to act on behalf of the business. That authority, however, may be limited; an express contract specifies the limitations of an agent's authority.

; fixed-price contract : A [[contract]] which is framed in such a way that, when the [[general contractor|contractor]] finishes the agreed-upon work, it will only receive the pre-arranged compensation, regardless of what their costs were.  The compensation is usually based on the expected expense of completing the work, plus a pre-arranged amount, so that the contractor can earn a [[profit]] instead of breaking even.  If the contractor is able to complete the work under-budget, those savings become extra profit.  Going over-budget, however, reduces the amount of profit realized from the contract and may even result in the contract being a net financial loss, providing strong incentive to minimize expenses.  This is in contrast to a [[cost-plus contract]].

==G==
; Grantee : A ''grantee'' is a person to whom something is granted.  In a franchise agreement, for example, the party buying the franchise is the grantee.

; Grantor : A ''grantor'' is a person who grants something (typically, rights or real property).  In a franchise agreement, for example, the party selling the franchise is the grantor.

; ''[[in loco parentis|In loco parentis]]'' : A person who has custodial/parental responsibility and authority although not actually being a parent (literally: "in place of the parents").  Although this can be established by written contract it is often assumed in common situations; thus a sibling or babysitter may have limited rights to act ''in loco parentis'' until the legal custodial parties (parents etc.) can be contacted.

; ''[[in medias res|In medias res]]'' : Literally, "in the midst of things".

; [[injunction|Injunction]] : Any court order prohibiting some parties from specific actions and/or activities (for example, working for a competitor in breach of duty to an existing employer) on penalty of contempt of court.

Some jurisdictions classify all violations of law which are less than [[felony|felonies]] as [[misdemeanour]]s, however generally a violation of law which is only punishable by a fine, and which cannot be punished by imprisonment, is considered an [[infraction]] (and not a crime), rather than a misdemeanour.

; Mistrial : Erroneous or invalid trial. Usually declared because of prejudicial error in the proceedings, hung jury, or when the proceedings must be interrupted.

; ''Pro hac vice'' : "For this occasion", application by an out-of-state lawyer to represent his or her client.
