==A==

; [[adenine]] : A [[base]], C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub>, found in certain glands and tissues, which pairs with [[thymine]] in [[DNA]] and [[uracil]] in [[RNA]].

; [[allele]] : One of a number of alternative forms of the same gene occupying a given position on a chromosome.

==C==

; [[chromosome]] : A structure in the cell nucleus that contains DNA, histone protein, and other structural proteins.

; [[codon]] : A sequence of three adjacent nucleotides, which encode for a specific amino acid during protein synthesis, or translation. 

; [[cytosine]] : A [[base]], C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O, which pairs with [[guanine]] in [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].

==D==

; [[diploid]] : Of a cell, having a pair of each type of chromosome, one of the pair is derived from the ovum and the other from the spermatozoon. See also haploid.

; [[DNA]] : Deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic material of nearly all forms of life.

; [[dominant]] : Of an allele, determining the trait when paired with a recessive one.

==G==

; [[gamete]] : A reproductive cell (male (sperm) or female (egg)) that has only half the usual number of chromosomes.

; [[gene]] : A unit of heredity; a segment of DNA or RNA that is transmitted from one generation to the next, and that carries genetic information such as the sequence of amino acids for a protein.

; [[gene pool]] : The complete set of unique alleles that would be found by inspecting the genetic material of every living member of a species or population.

; [[genome]] : The complete DNA content of an organism, typically expressed in number of basepairs.

; [[genotype]] : The combination of alleles, situated on corresponding chromosomes, that determines a specific trait of an individual, such as "Aa" or "aa".

; [[guanine]] : A substance first obtained from guano; it is a nucleic base and pairs with cytosine in DNA and RNA.

==H==

; [[haploid]] : Of a cell having a single set of unpaired chromosomes, such as a gamete. See also diploid.

; [[heterozygote]] : A diploid individual that has different alleles at one or more genetic loci.

; [[homozygote]] :  A diploid individual that has equal alleles at one or more genetic loci.

==M==

; [[mutation]] : Any heritable change in the base-pair sequence of genetic material, namely DNA (or RNA in the case of some viruses).

==N==

; [[nucleic acid]] : Any acidic, chainlike biological macromolecule consisting of multiply repeat units of phosphoric acid, sugar and purine and pyrimidine bases.

; [[nucleobase]] : The base of a nucleic acid, which include thymine, uracil and adenine, cytosine and guanine.

; [[nucleotide]] : The monomer comprising DNA or RNA biopolymer molecules.

==O==

; [[ovum]] : The female gamete in animals; the egg.

==R==

; [[recessive]] : Of an allele, yielding to the choice made by the dominante alelle.

; [[recombination]] : The formation of genetic combinations in offspring that are not present in the parents.

; [[RNA]] : Ribonucleic acid.

==S==

; [[spermatozoon]] : The reproductive cell or gamete of the male, carried in semen, that fertilizes the ovum to produce the zygote. Synonyms: sperm cell.

==T==

; [[thymine]] : A base, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, obtained by applying sulphuric acid to thymic acid; it pairs with [[adenine]] in [[DNA]].

==U==

; [[uracil]] : One of the bases of RNA which pairs with adenine and is symbolised by U.

==Z==

; [[zygote]] : A fertilized egg cell.
