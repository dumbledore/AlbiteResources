Although midrashim often take narrative form, the classic method of midrashic exegesis is the decontextualization and recontextualization of words in the Tanakh, especially through the juxtaposition of similar words from different chapters or books of the Tanakh.  Apparently new meanings are created (or discovered) through the play of words in the Biblical text.  This form contrasts most disinctly with Remez [[???]], the allegorical method of reading texts.

* Pasuk [[????]]
::''Pasuk'' (plural [[??????]] pesukim) is the transliteration of the Hebrew word for verse, specifically a verse in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]].
* [[Pharisees]]
:: The word Pharisees comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[??????]] ''prushim'' from [[????]] ''parush'', meaning  "separated", that is, one who is separated for a life of purity<ref>Ernest Klein - ''Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language''</ref>. The Pharisees were, depending on the time, a political party, a social movement, and a school of thought among Jews that flourished during the Second Temple Era (536 BCE&ndash;[[70|70 CE]]).  After the destruction of the Second Temple, the Pharisaic sect was re-established as Rabbinic Judaism &mdash; which ultimately produced normative, traditional Judaism, the basis for all contemporary forms of Judaism and even the Karaites use the Rabbinic canon of the Bible.

==R==
<!--Only add a term if it has its own article. Include brief summary of main article introduction content only for term descriptions. Discuss introduction content in main article Talk, not here.-->

* [[Kabbalah|Remez]]/Allegory
::'''allegory''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ?????, ''allos,'' "other", and ?????????, ''agoreuein,'' "to speak in public") is a figurative mode of representation conveying a meaning other than the [[literal]]. Generally treated as a figure of [[rhetoric]], but an allegory does not have to be expressed in [[language]]: it may be addressed to the eye, and is often found in realistic [[painting]], [[sculpture]] or some other form of mimetic, or representative art.

::In allegorical representations, relationships between elements of a text or composition are understood to stand for different relationships between elements not found in the text or composition; meaning is thus constituted through the difference between the superficial (or literal) meaning of the text or composition, and a "deeper" meaning.  In Jewish thought this method is best known through the works of Philo.  The extreme form of remez, sod, understands the Tanakh as an allegory for a mystical understanding of the universe and as a means for mystical communion with God; this approach is best known through [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] texts such as the [[Zohar]].  Traditionally, only Jews who have mastered the midrashic method and the corpus of halakha are encouraged to pursue this form of interpretation.
*Resurrection of the dead

==S==

* Seven Laws of Noah
* Shechinah [[?????]]
::''Shechinah'' is derived from the Hebrew verb [[???]] meaning literally ''to settle,'' ''inhabit,'' or ''dwell''. The Shekinah is held by many to represent the feminine attributes of the presence of God (''shekhinah'' being a feminine word in Hebrew), based especially on readings of the [[Talmud]].<ref>Eisenberg, Ronald L. The JPS Guide to Jewish Traditions. The Jewish Publication Society, 2004. ISBN 0-8276-0760-1</ref>  The Shekhinah is referred to as manifest in the Tabernacle and the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] throughout Rabbinic literature. It is also reported as being present in the acts of public prayer, ("Whenever ten are gathered for prayer, there the Shechinah rests" Talmud Sanhedrin 39a); righteous judgment ("when three sit as judges, the Shechinah is with them." Talmud Berachot 6a), and personal need ("The Shechinah dwells over the headside of the sick man's bed" Talmud Shabbat 12b; "Wheresoever they were exiled, the Shechinah went with them." Megillah 29a).
* Shema Yisrael [[??? ?????]]
::a crucial prayer in Judaism, drawn from Biblical passages and recited daily
* Shofar [[????]]
* Shituf [[????]]
::(or shittuf) describes the worship or belief of other gods in addition to the Hebrew God.

It is also known as the ''Five Books of Moses'', the ''Book of Moses'', the ''Law of Moses'' (''Torat Moshe'' [[???? ???]]), ''Sefer Torah'' [[??? ????]] in Hebrew (which refers to the [[scroll]] cases in which the books were kept), or Pentateuch (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ??????????? "five rolls or cases").  Constitutes the covenant between God and Israel. Physical Torah scrolls, written by scribes, are considered sacred symbols of the continuing love between God and Israel and are treated with the utmost care and respect.

* Tzedakah [[????]]

* Yarmulke, a skullcap
* Yetzer Hara [[??? ???]]
::([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] “bad inclination.”)  A part of human nature, which is most commonly understood as a tendency to commit wrongful acts.  It is not viewed as a state of being, but as one of two competing tendencies (good and bad).  Understood as the animal nature, responsible for desires to eat, procreate, etc.<ref>A. Cohen 1949 ''Everyman's Talmud'' p.90 N.Y.: E.P. Dutten</ref>  There would be no earthly survival without it, and though Jews are encouraged to rise above it, they are not encouraged to eliminate it.  Instead, when a child comes of age (13 for boys and 12 for girls) he is considered to have added the [[??? ????]] “Yetzer HaTov”; literally “Good Inclination.”<ref>A. Cohen 1949 ''Everyman's Talmud'' p.89 N.Y.: E.P. Dutten</ref>  As the Yetzer Hara is responsible for personal survival, the Yetzer HaTov is responsible for helping others to survive.  Without the Yetzer HaRa, there would be no sex and no children.  Without the Yetzer HaTov there would be no feeding and nurturing of children.  Both are essential (and when in harmony, good) aspects of humanity.  It cannot be equated with the Christian concept of Original Sin (which has no good aspects).<ref>A. Cohen 1949 ''Everyman's Talmud'' p.96 N.Y.: E.P. Dutten.  L. Jacobs 1973 ''A jewish Theology'' pp. 246-247, New York:Berman House</ref>   Further, although Original Sin condemns a person to hell without salvation, the Yetzer Hara does not.  The Jew does not need to be saved from his humanity,<ref>M. Steinberg 1947 ''Basic judaisn'' pp. 71-73 N.Y.: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich</ref> but instead needs to “grow up” in it.
